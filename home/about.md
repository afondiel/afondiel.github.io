Hello, 

I’m Afonso Diela, a passionate Software Engineer currently based in Paris, France. With over 5 years of experience in the embedded systems within the automotive industry.

My work is driven by my greatest passions: automobiles, <a href="https://twitter.com/muntudiela/status/1683560038097383425/photo/1" target="_blank">motorsports</a> and new technologies. I like to leverage technology to solve real-world problems and create positive social impact, and I am currently interested in artificial intelligence and robotics applications in smart mobility and Education.

I aspire to combine my experience in automotive software development with cutting-edge insights I’ve gained from the University of Toronto’s <a href="https://medium.com/@muntudiela/the-top-5-skills-i-learned-from-the-university-of-toronto-self-driving-cars-specialization-2023-6470b36fe7ed" target="_blank">Self-Driving Cars Specialization</a>, in order to implement smart mobility solutions to help shape the future of transportation.

I am eager to use my skills and experience to help startups & companies develop and implement innovative <a href="https://github.com/diesimo-ai" target="_blank"> smart mobility solutions</a>, to make transportation safer, sustainable, and more accessible for everyone.

I'm particularly drawn to mobility projects that focus on improving the lives of people with disabilities and seniors. If you're a nonprofit organization in **healthcare** or **road safety** interested in working with me to develop innovative smart mobility solutions, please contact me today for a **free** consultation.

I’d be glad to hear about the projects and the challenges your team is facing and discuss potential collaborations. Let’s Connect ☕

Cheers

Afonso
