# Why Lab-42  ?
The number 42 is often associated with the concept of the **ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything**, as it is the answer given by the supercomputer Deep Thought in Douglas Adams' science fiction novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

The motivation behind this is to try to solve any problem around the sujects that I described above or try to bring up an "aproximative" answer to the problem. I deeply believe that nothing is impossible and there is a solution for every problem.

> Why was the number 42 always tired? Because it was constantly carrying the weight of the universe on its shoulders! ~ Joke by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat)
