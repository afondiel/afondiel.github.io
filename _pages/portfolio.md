## Why Lab-42?

The number 42 is often associated with the concept of the **"ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything"** - as given by the supercomputer `Deep Thought` in Douglas Adams' science fiction novel [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(novel)).

The motivation behind Lab-42 is to try to solve any problem around the  listed fields above or try at least provide a close solution to them. I firmly believe that anything is possible and there is a solution for every problem the universe puts in our way.
