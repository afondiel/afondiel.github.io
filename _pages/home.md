Hello, I'm Afonso Diela, a passionate Software Engineer currently based in Paris, France. With over 5 years of experience in the embedded systems within the automotive industry.

I am passionate about cars and [motorsports](https://twitter.com/muntudiela/status/1683560038097383425/photo/1), but above all I like to use technology to solve real-world problems. I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence and robotics applications in smart mobility.

I aspire to combine my experience in automotive software development with the latest expertise I've gained from the  University of Toronto's [self-driving car specialization](https://medium.com/@muntudiela/the-top-5-skills-i-learned-from-the-university-of-toronto-self-driving-cars-specialization-2023-6470b36fe7ed), to help shape the future of transportation.

I am eager to use my skills and experience to help companies develop and implement innovative smart mobility solutions, to make transportation safer, sustainable, and more accessible for everyone.

I am also interested in working on mobility projects that focus on improving lives of the people with disabilities and seniors. 

So, if you are a **nonprofit organization in healthcare** aiming to help people with disabilities move through the world safely. Or, if you are a **nonprofit organization in road or driving safety** aiming to improve road safety and prevent road fatalities. I'm offering a **FREE** Service and Consultations.  

I'd be glad to hear about the projects and the challenges you are facing. Let's Connect â˜•
